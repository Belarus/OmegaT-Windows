You can set passwords to expire after a number of days between 1 and 999, or you can specify that passwords never expire by setting the number of days to 0. If the maximum password age is between 1 and 999 days, the Minimum password age must be less than the maximum password age. If the maximum password age is set to 0, the minimum password age can be any value between 0 and 998 days.\r\n\r\nNote: It is a security best practice to have passwords expire every 30 to 90 days, depending on your environment. This way, an attacker has a limited amount of time in which to crack a user's password and have access to your network resources.\r\n\r\nDefault: 42."

Without a minimum password age, users can cycle through passwords repeatedly until they get to an old favorite. The default setting does not follow this recommendation, so that an administrator can specify a password for a user and then require the user to change the administrator-defined password when the user logs on.

Storing passwords using reversible encryption is essentially the same as storing plaintext versions of the passwords. For this reason, this policy should never be enabled unless application requirements outweigh the need to protect password information.\r\n\r\nThis policy is required when using Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) authentication through remote access or Internet Authentication Services (IAS).

The setting must be greater than 10 minutes and less than or equal to the setting for Maximum lifetime for user ticket.\r\n\r\nIf a client presents an expired session ticket when it requests a connection to a server, the server returns an error message. The client must request a new session ticket from the Kerberos V5 Key Distribution Center (KDC). Once a connection is authenticated, however, it no longer matters whether the session ticket remains valid. Session tickets are used only to authenticate new connections with servers. Ongoing operations are not interrupted if the session ticket that is used to authenticate the connection expires during the connection.\r\n\r\nDefault: 600 minutes (10 hours)."

For time stamps to work properly, the clocks of the client and the domain controller need to be in sync as much as possible. In other words, both computers must be set to the same time and date. Because the clocks of two computers are often out of sync, administrators can use this policy to establish the maximum acceptable difference to Kerberos V5 between a client clock and domain controller clock. If the difference between a client clock and the domain controller clock is less than the maximum time difference that is specified in this policy, any time stamp that is used in a session between the two computers is considered to be authentic.\r\n\r\nImportant\r\n\r\nThis setting is not persistent on pre Vista platforms.

Domain members and non-domain-joined machines are authoritative for their local accounts; domain controllers are all authoritative for accounts in the domain. Credential validation may be in support of a local logon, or, in the case of an Active Directory domain account on a domain controller, may be in support of a logon to another computer.

If this policy is disabled, the SMB client will never negotiate SMB packet signing.\r\n\r\nDefault: Enabled on domain controllers only.\r\n\r\nImportant\r\n\r\nFor Windows 2000 servers to negotiate signing with Windows NT 4.0 clients, the following registry value must be set to 1 on the server running Windows 2000: HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\lanmanserver\\parameters\\enableW9xsecuritysignature\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nAll Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. To take advantage of SMB packet signing, both the client-side SMB component and server-side SMB component that are involved in a communication must have SMB packet signing either enabled or required. For Windows 2000 and above, enabling or requiring packet signing for client and server-side SMB components is controlled by the following four policy settings:\r\nMicrosoft network client: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component requires packet signing.\r\nMicrosoft network client: Digitally sign communications (if server agrees) - Controls whether or not the client-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.\r\nMicrosoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component requires packet signing.\r\nMicrosoft network server: Digitally sign communications (if client agrees) - Controls whether or not the server-side SMB component has packet signing enabled.\r\nIf server-side SMB signing is required, a client will not be able to establish a session with that server unless it has client-side SMB signing enabled. By default, client-side SMB signing is enabled on workstations, servers, and domain controllers.\r\nSimilarly, if client-side SMB signing is required, that client will not be able to establish a session with servers that do not have packet signing enabled. By default, server-side SMB signing is enabled only on domain controllers.\r\nIf server-side SMB signing is enabled, SMB packet signing will be negotiated with clients that have client-side SMB signing enabled.\r\nUsing SMB packet signing can impose up to a 15 percent performance hit on file service transactions.\r\n\r\n"

  2041,  "Restricted Groups\r\n\r\nThis security setting allows an administrator to define two properties for security-sensitive groups (""restricted"" groups).\r\n\r\nThe two properties are Members and Member Of. The Members list defines who belongs and who does not belong to the restricted group. The Member Of list specifies which other groups the restricted group belongs to.\r\n\r\nWhen a Restricted Groups Policy is enforced, any current member of a restricted group that is not on the Members list is removed. Any user on the Members list who is not currently a member of the restricted group is added.\r\n\r\nYou can use Restricted Groups policy to control group membership. Using the policy, you can specify what members are part of a group. Any members that are not specified in the policy are removed during configuration or refresh. In addition, the reverse membership configuration option ensures that each Restricted Group is a member of only those groups that are specified in the Member Of column.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can create a Restricted Groups policy to only allow specified users (for example, Alice and John) to be members of the Administrators group. When policy is refreshed, only Alice and John will remain as members of the Administrators group.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to apply Restricted Groups policy:\r\n\r\nDefine the policy in a security template, which will be applied during configuration on your local computer.\r\nDefine the setting on a Group Policy object (GPO) directly, which means that the policy goes into effect with every refresh of policy.

Group Policy only allows audit policy to be set at the category level, and existing group policy may override the subcategory settings of new machines as they are joined to the domain or upgraded to Windows Vista or later versions.

The SMB protocol supports validating the SMB server service principal name (SPN) within the authentication blob provided by a SMB client to  prevent a class of attacks against SMB servers referred to as SMB relay attacks. This setting will affect both SMB1 and SMB2.\r\n\r\nThis security setting determines the level of validation a SMB server performs on the service principal name (SPN) provided by the SMB client when trying to establish a session to an SMB server.\r\n\r\nThe options are:\r\n\r\nOff – the SPN  is not required or validated by the SMB server from a SMB client.\r\n\r\nAccept if provided by client – the SMB server will accept and validate the SPN provided by the SMB client and allow a session to be established if it matches the SMB server’s list of SPN’s for itself. If the SPN does NOT match, the session request for that SMB client will be denied.\r\n\r\nRequired from client - the SMB client MUST send a SPN name in session setup, and the SPN name provided MUST match the SMB server that is being requested to establish a connection.  If no SPN is provided by client, or the SPN provided does not match, the session is denied.\r\n\r\nDefault: Off\r\n\r\nAll Windows operating systems support both a client-side SMB component and a server-side SMB component. This setting affects the server SMB behavior, and its implementation should be carefully evaluated and tested to prevent disruptions to file and print serving capabilities. Additional information on implementing and using this to secure your SMB servers can be found at the Microsoft website  (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=144505)."
