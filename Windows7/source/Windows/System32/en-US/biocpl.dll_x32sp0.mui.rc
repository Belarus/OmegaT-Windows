You can contact your fingerprint reader provider or fingerprint software provider for additional information regarding the appropriate use of your device.\n\nYou can best protect private and sensitive information on your computer by using technologies that leverage hardware security devices, such as Trusted Platform Modules and smart cards, to enable the secure encryption of your data, and by limiting access with a strong password that you memorize, store in a secure place, or otherwise keep private in a manner that works for you, regardless of whether you use a fingerprint reader.
